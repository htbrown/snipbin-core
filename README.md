A simple, work-in-progress, REST-based code snippet organiser.

## Intentions

There are a few things I intend this project to be:
- small and simple;
- easy to install (preferrably with a Docker Compose file or something of the like);
- made with modern(ish) technologies;
- customisable;
- expandable with first- or third-party projects to provide a front-end.

## Expectations

I'm taking this as a learning opportunity, too. Constructive criticism is very much welcome - please submit an issue or PR! This is my first actual project with SQL (in particular using postgres) so things might be a bit rough around the edges for a while.

## Contributions

Please do contribute! If you've got something to add, submit your idea or code through the various means on GitHub. There are no formalities right now, just make it clear what you're trying to do.
